            <h2 class="mb-4">About Me</h2>
            <h4 class="mb-4">Who am I?</h4>
            <p>
                My name is Mathew Meisinger and I am currently in the process of transitioning from Critical Care Paramedic 
                to Software Engineer. I am born and raised in Cape Town, South Africa and am 1 of 4 children born to my parents 
                Thomas and Ingelise. My mother is South African and my father is Austrain. My father moved to South Africa with 
                his family when he was 11 years old and met my mother when they were both working for the same company. My family 
                has moved around a bit and lived in Australia and the UK for a time before coming back home and settling in Cape Town, 
                where I completed all my education.
            </p>
            <h4 class="mb-4">My Experiences</h4>
            <p>
                I have always been fortunate enough to have a variety of experiences thanks to my parents encouraging us to try new things 
                as well as taking us on trips around Africa, the surrounding countries and then the rest of the world. These experiences include 
                exposure to wildlife, the ocean and a variety of different cultures from around the world. These experiences have shaped me into the person I am today 
                and have given me a unique perspective on life and the world around me. For this I can only be grateful to my parents for giving me these opportunities.
            </p>
            <h4 class="mb-4">My Passions and Motivations</h4>
            <p>
                From an early age I have always had a passion for helping people and solving problems. This passion drove me first to becoming a lifeguard on the 
                beaches of Cape Town and then to becoming a Critical Care Paramedic. I have always been driven by the desire to make a difference in people's lives, as well as 
                solving complex problems and this has led me to pursue a career in software engineering where I can apply my problem-solving skills to create innovative solutions.
